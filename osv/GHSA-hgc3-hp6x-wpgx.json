  "summary": "Antilles Dependency Confusion Vulnerability",
  "details": "### Potential Impact: \nRemote code execution.\n\n### Scope of Impact: \nOpen-source project specific.\n\n### Summary Description:\nA dependency confusion vulnerability was reported in the Antilles open-source software prior to version 1.0.1 that could allow for remote code execution during installation due to a package listed in requirements.txt not existing in the public package index (PyPi). \nMITRE classifies this weakness as an Uncontrolled Search Path Element (CWE-427) in which a private package dependency may be replaced by an unauthorized package of the same name published to a well-known public repository such as PyPi.\nThe configuration has been updated to only install components built by Antilles, removing all other public package indexes. Additionally, the antilles-tools dependency has been published to PyPi.\n\n### Mitigation Strategy for Customers (what you should do to protect yourself):\nRemove previous versions of Antilles as a precautionary measure and Update to version 1.0.1 or later.\n\n### Acknowledgement:\nThe Antilles team thanks Kotko Vladyslav for reporting this issue.\n\n### References:\nhttps://github.com/lenovo/Antilles/commit/c7b9c5740908b343aceefe69733d9972e64df0b9\n",
