  "details": "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. An attacker can cause a heap buffer overflow in `tf.raw_ops.RaggedTensorToTensor`. This is because the implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/d94227d43aa125ad8b54115c03cece54f6a1977b/tensorflow/core/kernels/ragged_tensor_to_tensor_op.cc#L219-L222) uses the same index to access two arrays in parallel. Since the user controls the shape of the input arguments, an attacker could trigger a heap OOB access when `parent_output_index` is shorter than `row_split`. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.",
