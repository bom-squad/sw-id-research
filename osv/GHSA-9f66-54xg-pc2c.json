  "summary": "Jupyter Server open redirect vulnerability",
  "details": "### Impact\n_What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?_\n\nOpen redirect vulnerability - a maliciously crafted link to a jupyter server could redirect the browser to a different website.\n\nAll jupyter servers running without a base_url prefix are technically affected, however, these maliciously crafted links can only be reasonably made for known jupyter server hosts. A link to your jupyter server may *appear* safe, but ultimately redirect to a spoofed server on the public internet. This same vulnerability was patched in upstream notebook v5.7.8.\n\n### Patches\n\n_Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?_\n\nPatched in jupyter_server 1.1.1. If upgrade is not available, a workaround can be to run your server on a url prefix:\n\n```\njupyter server --ServerApp.base_url=/jupyter/\n```\n\n### References\n\n[OWASP page on open redirects](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Unvalidated_Redirects_and_Forwards_Cheat_Sheet.html)\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, or vulnerabilities to report, please email our security list [security@ipython.org](mailto:security@ipython.org).\n\nCredit: Yaniv Nizry from CxSCA group at Checkmarx",
