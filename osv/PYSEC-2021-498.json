  "details": "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. The implementation of `tf.raw_ops.MaxPoolGradWithArgmax` can cause reads outside of bounds of heap allocated data if attacker supplies specially crafted inputs. The implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/ef0c008ee84bad91ec6725ddc42091e19a30cf0e/tensorflow/core/kernels/maxpooling_op.cc#L1016-L1017) uses the same value to index in two different arrays but there is no guarantee that the sizes are identical. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.",
